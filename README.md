# I M Share

A P2P File sharing system similar to Torrent, where users can seed[upload] or download files simultaneously. Currently I have implemented a browser based client in react js which utilizes web workers to paralelly upload/download files. Backend is implemented in Node Js. Entire application is powered by the magic of Socket Programming.

Application currently in Development Phase
